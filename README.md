# Acceleration-Based-User-Authentication
As people increasingly use digital devices to access sensitive information, it is crucial to have an enhanced authentication method that safeguards user data from unauthorized access. This project seeks to evaluate acceleration-based features and explore their potential for verifying user identity through NNs.

The major steps are outlined as follows:
- Preprocess the dataset.
- Extract features.
- Split data for training and testing.
- Create reference and test templates.
- Design and train NNs.
- Evaluate performance.
